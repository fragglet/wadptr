.SH NAME
wadptr \- compression tool for .wad files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wadptr
.RB [options]
[ -c | -d | -l ]
.I wadfile...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B wadptr
is a tool for compressing Doom .wad files. It takes advantage of the
structure of the WAD format and some of the lumps stored inside it to
merge repeated data.
.PP
.SH COMMAND SYNTAX
wadptr has three separate subcommands:
.TP
\fB-l\fR
List contents of the specified WAD, showing detail about which lumps
are compressed or merged with other lumps.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Compress the specified .wad file.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Decompress the specified .wad file.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
wadptr has several additional options:
.TP
\fB-o filename.wad\fR
Write the output .wad file to the given filename, instead of overwriting
the original file.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet mode. Normal output that is printed when compressing or
decompressing files is suppressed, making wadptr work more like a
normal Unix tool that only prints output when an error occurs.
.TP
\fB-nomerge\fR
Disables WAD lump merging (see the \fBcompression schemes\fR section
below). Cannot be used with decompress mode.
.TP
\fB-nopack\fR
Disables sidedef packing (see the \fBcompression schemes\fR section
below). In decompress mode, this disables sidedef \fIunpacking\fR.
.TP
\fB-nosquash\fR
Disables graphic squashing (see the \fBcompression schemes\fR section
below). In decompress mode, this disables graphic \fIunsquashing\fR.
.TP
\fB-nostack\fR
Disables blockmap stacking (see the \fBcompression schemes\fR section
below). In decompress mode, this disables blockmap \fIunstacking\fR.
.TP
\fB-extblocks\fR
Enables extended BLOCKMAP size limit, for WADs targeting limit-removing
source ports. This effectively doubles the limit, but the resulting
lump will not work with vanilla Doom.
.TP
\fB-extsides\fR
Enables extended sidedef count limit, for WADs targeting limit-removing
source ports. This effectively doubles the limit, but the resulting
lump will not work with vanilla Doom.
.TP
\fB-wipesides\fR
Clears lower and upper texture names of sidedefs on 1-sided linedefs.
This helps make sidedef packing more efficient, but must be explicitly
enabled because it is an irreversible change.
In the future this option may be extended to modify 2-sided linedefs as
well.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print version number.
.SH COMPRESSION SCHEMES
The following are some brief technical details about how wadptr's .wad
file compression works:
.TP
.B WAD lump merging
WAD files sometimes contain the same lump repeated multiple times. An
example is that in \fIdoom2.wad\fR, some of the music tracks are
repeated for multiple levels (eg. \fBD_ROMERO\fR and \fBD_ROMER2\fR).
Since the WAD directory format contains a pointer to the location of the
lump within the .wad file, multiple lumps that contain the same data can
be merged to point to the same data.
This behavior can be disabled using the \fB-nomerge\fR option.
.TP
.B Sidedef packing
Doom's levels are constructed out of lines called \fIlinedefs\fR. Each
linedef can have one or two \fIsidedefs\fR which contain data about which
texture to show on that side of the linedef. Since it's common for many
linedefs to use the same textures, these identical sidedefs can be
merged and shared by multiple linedefs.
This behavior can be disabled using the \fB-nopack\fR option.
.TP
.B Graphic squashing
Doom's graphics format splits images into vertical columns. A table
stores the offset of each column within the lump. Sometimes an image can
contain the same identical column multiple times. These identical
columns can be merged together and the table offsets changed to point to
the same data. This compression scheme works most effectively on images
that are either very simple, based on repeating patterns, or those
containing flat fields of a single color.
This behavior can be disabled using the \fB-nosquash\fR option.
.TP
.B Blockmap stacking
A precomputed table named the blockmap is used for collision detection;
it divides up each level into 128x128 blocks and indexes which lines
appear in each block. Often, different blocks contain the same identical
set of lines. This compression scheme saves space by merging identical
blocks together.
This behavior can be disabled using the \fB-nostack\fR option.

To see an example of wadptr used in a very effective way, see miniwad,
a minimalist Doom-compatible IWAD file that is less than 250KiB in size:

.SH SIDEDEFS ON SPECIAL LINES
When packing sidedefs, linedefs with special types always get unique
sidedefs that are not shared with any other linedefs. This is to avoid
problems with animated walls, such as:
.IP \(bu
Scrolling walls; if multiple scrolling wall linedefs share the same
sidedef, these walls will all scroll faster than normal. Non-scrolling
walls that share the same sidedef will also scroll unintentionally.
.IP \(bu
Wall switches; if multiple switch lines share the same sidedef, pressing
one will animate all others.
.PP
wadptr's behavior is maybe excessively cautious in that it applies to any
and all special lines, but since only very few linedefs in a typical level
are special lines this is judged to be a reasonable tradeoff.
.PP
However, if wadptr repacks the sidedefs on a level that was already
packed by another, less cautious, tool, the resulting sidedefs lump may
be slightly larger than the original. While counterintuitive given the
purpose of the program is to make WADs smaller, this is almost certainly
what you want to happen; other tools that do sidedef packing less
cautiously may cause unintended visual glitches to occur.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The \fB-c\fR command will compress a WAD file and the \fB-d\fR command
can then be used to restore the original decompressed file. However, the
decompressed file may not exactly match the original file byte-for-byte.
For example, some editors already pack sidedefs, and sometimes WAD files
include junk data that wadptr will discard. If for some reason it's
important to retain the original file, you should therefore make sure to
to either back up the original file before using wadptr, or use the
\fB-o\fR command line option to write to a different file.
.PP
For compatibility reasons, wadptr's blockmap stacking is deliberately
very conservative. Far more aggressive techniques can be used to shrink
blockmap lumps further, particularly for large levels that run up
against the blockmap size limit. If you need this, check out
.UR https://github.com/zokum-no/zokumbsp
ZokumBSP.
.UE
.PP
Some levels are so large that it is impossible to unpack their sidedefs
or unstack their blockmap without exceeding the limits of the Doom level
format. If this happens when decompressing a level, "failed" will be
shown in the program output for that lump and the original (compressed)
lump will be copied into the output file unchanged. The \fB-extblocks\fR
and \fB-extsides\fR command line arguments can be specified to use the
extended limits instead of the vanilla limits, but the resulting levels
will only work in a limit-removing source port.
.PP
Some level editors get confused by packed sidedefs. If your level editor
has problems, use \fB-d\fR to decompress the file before editing.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some examples for how to invoke the program:
.TP
wadptr -c foo.wad
Compress \fBfoo.wad\fR, overwriting the original file.
.TP
wadptr -d foo.wad
Decompress \fBfoo.wad\fR, overwriting the original file.
.TP
wadptr -o newfoo.wad -c foo.wad
Compress \fBfoo.wad\fR but write the resulting file to \fBnewfoo.wad\fR.

.SH HISTORY
wadptr was originally written in 1998 by
.MT fraggle@gmail.com
Simon Howard
.ME
as a command-line program for MS-DOS. The first version worked as an adjunct
to \fBdeutex\fR(6), but with the 2.x series it changed to a standalone tool.
Sadly, versions before v2.2 have been lost to time and the v1.x series may have
never been publicly released at all. In 1999, Andreas Dehmel ported the program
to several different Unix systems and also to RISC OS. Simon continues to
maintain the project, and the source code was recently (writing in 2023)
overhauled and cleaned up.
.PP
The name, "wadptr", is prounounced "wad pointer" and is a reference to the
strategy of manipulating pointers within WAD files to combine repeated data.
Originally, it only performed WAD lump merging, but other strategies were later
incorporated to compress some of the lumps themselves in similar ways. Some of
these predate wadptr itself: the sidedef packing strategy was pioneered by the
\fBdshrink\fR tool (Rand Phares, 1994), and the invention of blockmap
compression is credited to Jason Hoffoss, author of \fBDMapEdit\fR, the feature
being subsequently added to \fBWARM\fR in 1995 in its v1.3 release, along with
other node builders.
