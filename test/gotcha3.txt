You wake from your nap... 
Was it a scream that had woke you... or just part of a dream?
This cleaning job just doesn't pay... 
Too many dangerous chemicals and wierd experiments going on in
the companies in this complex.
There is an odd smell that greets you as you Open the door. 
A revolver is laying on the ground. You pick it up and notice that
it is loaded. 
Just then there is a gutteral noise... An alarming yell...
You spin in time to see a crazed guard with a shotgun pointed at you! 
You run just as he fires. From the look in his eyes, it will be 
"shoot first and ask questions later"...

Description             : This is a map of an industrial complex.
                          It would seem that there has been some
                          wierd experiments going on with the
                          rival companies in this community.
                          It seems that while you were sleeping in
                          a secluded room, something has happened
                          to the security personnel that has made
                          them into killing machines.
                          It has well lit buildings with lots of
                          windows, the outside is kinda dark.
                          There are quite a few buildings and there
                          is a stream.  The weapons in this include
                          the shotgun, chaingun, and rocket launcher,
                          depending on the level of play and what
                          type of play. It is a good deathmatch level.
