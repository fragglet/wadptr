Description             : This is a map that is exclusive to Doom 64 EX (it
                          can be only played with 64 EX). Made by the Doom
                          Builder 64 (2 originally). It is a test map, but
                          I figured about publishing it.
                          
                          READ THIS TO RUN THE MAP:
                          1- Put it in your Doom 64EX folder.
                          2- Open the launcher and type at the bottom:
                          -file 64ways.wad
